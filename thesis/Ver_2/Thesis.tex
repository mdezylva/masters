% This is in my opinion a way better way of writing any large work in latex. You can work on each chapter individually without getting lost this way. I also found seeing all the chapter headings with to-do's under them helped me keep a good overview of where I was up to. I haven't included all my chapters, but I've left them in below, commented out, to give you an idea of how it looks.

	\include{Introduction}
 	
 	% Motivation
 	% Basic Grav lensing 
	%etc 
	 
	%\include{Ellipse_fitting}
	
	% Making galaxies or importing them 
	% Shearing galaxies
	% Determining the shear
	% Velocity curve and inclination angle
	% Fitting ellipses
	
	\include{Results}

	% Reproduction of the shear signal
	% Effect of varying spatial and velocity resolution
	% Recovery of the shear signal from real data
	% Discussion of problems with the results

	%\include{Prob_of_lensing}
	
	% Analysis of lensing probability


  %\include{Science_for_SKA}

	% Need for better quality data
	% Probability of lensing out to a given z
	% Science case for SKA based on this and results stuff
	
	%Further work:
	%app to real gals
	%complimentarity with current methods
	%h alpha 
	%prob of lensing
	%science case for SKA
	%fit for centroid later

 	\include{Conclusion}

	% Shown it can be done
	% Will be detectable when high enough resolution data becomes available
