\section{Motivation}
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) provides the most accurate and detailed measures of the primary cosmological parameters to date %\citep{2018arXiv180706209P}%.
For a $\Lambda$ CDM universe, there are six independant paramters which descirbe the evolution and behaviour of the universe, the physical baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$, the physical dark matter density $\Omega_c h^2$, the age of the universe $t_0$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$, the curvature fluctuation amplitude $\Delta_R^2$, and the reionisation optical depth $\tau$. 

Currently, the highest precision measures of these features from the CMB come from \cite{2018arXiv180706209P}, which details that baryonic matter only comprises $\approx 5 \% $ of the universe's energy density. In principle, this component of the universe should be directly measurable. At higher redshifts, in the regime where $z \geqslant 2$, the baryon fraction can be found in the absorption lines of quasars passing through the diffuse, photo-ionised intergalactic medium, known as the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest \citep{1997ApJ...490..564W}. However, as time moved more towards the present, this gas becomes sparser as it becomes more ionised
